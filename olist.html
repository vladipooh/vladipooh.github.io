          <p>
            To enable rich analytics on customer experience, product performance, logistics, and geography,
            we <strong>merged all 9 raw datasets</strong> into a unified DataFrame using <code>pandas</code> in Python.
            This created a highly enriched dataset capturing information from product category to seller location.
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>olist_orders_dataset.csv</strong>: Base table containing <code>order_id</code>,
              <code>customer_id</code>, and timestamps
            </li>
            <li><strong>olist_customers_dataset.csv</strong>: Joined on <code>customer_id</code> to add
              <code>customer_city</code> and <code>customer_state</code>
            </li>
            <li><strong>olist_order_reviews_dataset.csv</strong>: Joined on <code>order_id</code> to bring in
              <code>review_score</code> and <code>comments</code>
            </li>
            <li><strong>olist_geolocation_dataset.csv</strong>: Aggregated by ZIP prefix to approximate
              <code>lat/lng</code> for city-state mapping
            </li>
            <li><strong>olist_order_items_dataset.csv</strong>: Merged on <code>order_id</code> to connect to
              <code>product_id</code> and <code>seller_id</code>
            </li>
            <li><strong>olist_products_dataset.csv</strong>: Merged on <code>product_id</code> for <code>category</code>
              and physical attributes</li>
            <li><strong>product_category_name_translation.csv</strong>: Used to translate
              <code>product_category_name</code> from Portuguese to English
            </li>
            <li><strong>olist_sellers_dataset.csv</strong>: Joined on <code>seller_id</code> to map seller location</li>

          <h2 class="mb-3">üîÑ Category Translation Handling</h2>
          <p>
            After merging the product dataset (<code>olist_products_dataset.csv</code>) with the translation file
            (<code>product_category_name_translation.csv</code>),
            we found that some Portuguese product categories did not have matching English translations.
            These untranslated categories were grouped under the label <strong>‚Äúunknown‚Äù</strong> to preserve data
            integrity and structure.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‚ö†Ô∏è <strong>Note:</strong> This implies that the translation file was incomplete. Any analysis involving
            product categories
            (e.g., segmentation or visualizations by category) should consider this "unknown" group carefully,
            as it may impact the accuracy of insights derived from the data.

          <p>
            This dashboard provides a high-level summary of Olist's e-commerce performance over a two-year period,
            from <strong>September 2016 to October 2018</strong>. It is designed to help stakeholders assess business
            growth,
            customer satisfaction, and delivery performance across multiple dimensions.
          </p>
          <p>
            üîé <strong>Applied Filters:</strong><br>
            All visualizations across this Tableau Story are filtered to include only orders that meet the following
            conditions:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Payment Types:</strong> Boleto, Credit Card, Debit Card, and Voucher</li>
            <li><strong>Order Status:</strong> Delivered</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            These filters ensure that the analysis focuses solely on
            <strong>completed transactions with valid payment methods</strong>, providing a more accurate view of
            customer behavior and fulfillment metrics.
          </p>

          <h2 class="mb-3 mt-4">üî¢ Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Total Sales</strong>: R$ 19,881,945 ‚Äì the total revenue generated from all delivered orders in
              this timeframe.</li>
            <li><strong>Total Orders</strong>: 96,477 ‚Äì the number of completed (delivered) transactions on the
              platform.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Average Review Score</strong>: 4.1 ‚Äì indicating overall high customer satisfaction based on
              post-delivery feedback.</li>
            <li><strong>Average Delivery Time</strong>: 12.43 days ‚Äì representing the average number of days it took for
              orders to be delivered after purchase.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 class="mb-3 mt-4">üìà Sales by Time (Left Chart)</h2>
          <p>
            This dual-axis chart shows two important trends:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Bar Chart (Blue)</strong>: Represents monthly sales in Brazilian Real (R$).</li>
            <li><strong>Line Chart (Red)</strong>: Tracks the number of orders each month.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Sales volume and order count gradually increased throughout 2017 and remained strong into 2018, peaking
            around
            late 2017.
            This suggests significant platform growth and seasonality effects (e.g., end-of-year spikes).
          </p>

          <h2 class="mb-3 mt-4">üìä Review Score Distribution (Right Pie Chart)</h2>
          <p>
            This pie chart shows the proportion of customer review scores (1 to 5 stars) received after order delivery:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>‚≠ê <strong>5 stars</strong>: 57.50% ‚Äì Majority of customers were highly satisfied.</li>
            <li>‚≠ê <strong>4 stars</strong>: 19.28%</li>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Order Status</strong>: e.g., Delivered</li>
            <li><strong>Month, Year of Order</strong>: for time-based filtering</li>

          <img class="img-fluid w-100 rounded mb-4" src="img/project/olistdb2.png" alt="olist dashboard2">
          <p>
            This dashboard presents a detailed view of customer satisfaction based on
            review scores.
            The data is filtered for <strong>delivered orders only</strong>. The goal is to evaluate how different
            product categories perform in terms of review scores,
            delivery times, number of orders, and sales volume.
          </p>

          <h2 class="mt-4">üìä Top and Bottom 5 Categories by Review Score</h2>
          <p>
            On the left, we see the <strong>top 5 product categories</strong> with the highest customer satisfaction.
            Notably, <code>books_general_interest</code> and <code>books_imported</code> received the highest volume of
            reviews with high ratings.
            On the right, we see the <strong>bottom 5 categories</strong> such as <code>office_furniture</code> and
            <code>fasion_male_clothing</code>,
            which received a large number of low-rated reviews. These insights can guide product quality improvement and
            supplier evaluation.
          </p>

          <h2 class="mt-4">üìà Review Score vs Delivery Days</h2>
          <p>
            The heatmap below shows the correlation between <strong>average review score and delivery duration</strong>.
            It is evident that as delivery time increases, the average review score tends to decrease, especially beyond
            the 15‚Äì20 day mark.
            This highlights the importance of <strong>efficient logistics and prompt delivery</strong> in maintaining
            customer satisfaction.
          </p>

          <h2 class="mt-4">üìã Summary Table</h2>
          <p>
            On the right, a summary table provides insights for each product category including:
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Average Review Score</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Average Delivery Days</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Number of Orders</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Total Sales (R$)</strong></li>
          </ul>
          For example, <code>fashion_childrens_clothes</code> has a perfect 5.0 average review score and very short
          delivery time (8.86 days),
          while <code>fashion_shoes</code> shows relatively low satisfaction due to longer delivery
          durations (15.28 days).
          </p>

          <p>
            There is a clear link between <strong>delivery speed</strong> and
            <strong>customer satisfaction</strong>.
            Prioritizing faster delivery and enhancing logistics for lower-rated product categories could significantly
            improve overall user experience.

          <p>
            The red map on the right shows the distribution of sellers. Similar to the customer map, the <strong>circle
              size</strong> represents the number of sellers
            while the <strong>red color intensity</strong> shows the <strong>total product price value</strong> sold
            from each state.
          <ul>
            <li>The seller distribution closely mirrors customer distribution, with a strong presence in the southeast,
              particularly in S√£o Paulo.</li>
            <li>This may indicate that sellers tend to locate themselves closer to areas with higher demand to optimize
              logistics and reduce delivery times.</li>
          </ul>
          </p>

          <p>
            Both customer demand and seller supply are heavily concentrated in the
            southeastern states of Brazil.
            This insight is crucial for logistics planning, regional marketing, and inventory allocation strategies.

          <p>
            To understand customer purchasing behavior, we applied <strong>K-Means clustering</strong> using three
            features:
            <strong>total spending</strong>, <strong>number of orders</strong>, and <strong>review score</strong>. To
            determine
            the optimal number of clusters, we used two key metrics:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>WCSS (Within-Cluster Sum of Squares):</strong> measures compactness of clusters</li>
            <li><strong>Silhouette Score:</strong> measures separation between clusters</li>
          </ul>
          <img class="img-fluid w-75 rounded mb-3" src="img/project/olistsegmentation2.png" alt="elbow silhouette plot">
          <p>

            The plot above shows both metrics across k = 2 to 10. Based on the elbow point and silhouette peak,
            <strong>k = 6</strong> was selected as optimal.

          </p>
          <ul>

          <p>
            To visualize clusters in 2D space, we used <strong>Principal Component Analysis (PCA)</strong>. Each point
            represents a customer, and the color indicates their assigned cluster.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>PCA Component 1</strong> and <strong>PCA Component 2</strong> capture the most variance in the

          <p>
            <strong>Which sellers generate the highest sales per single order?</strong><br>
            The goal here is to identify sellers with the highest revenue per transaction, revealing opportunities for
            maximizing revenue efficiency.
          </p>

          <p>
            Top high-value sellers tend to operate in <strong>specialized or high-ticket product categories</strong>,
            such as Fixed Telephony, Garden Tools, and Computers. These sellers demonstrate the potential for
            significant revenue with just a few orders.
